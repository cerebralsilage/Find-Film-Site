# Find Film Website

This site was a codeacdemy project in which we had to hook up to the themoviedb.org api so we could run our game through their databases.  Many updates were added including cast, rating, release date, sorting through genres, selecting random movies from random genre pages, and a liked movie section that adds your liked movies to the page.  I did not bother making the page responsive, although I may change that in the future.  For now it is computer only.

To try it out you will have to already have an api key or go to themoviedb.org and sign up for one.  Then go to the script.js file and add your key on the third line, where it says "tmdbKey =".
